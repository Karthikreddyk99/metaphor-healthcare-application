# Healthcare Resources Application

This application provides a one-stop solution for healthcare resources using the Metaphor and GPT-3 APIs.

ABSTRACT-
This project is a comprehensive healthcare resource aggregator empowered by cutting-edge technologies. It seamlessly integrates Metaphor API, which provides advanced neural search capabilities, with the power of the LLM OpenAI API. The application offers three main functionalities:

Best Hospital Finder: Users can search for top hospitals based on specific diseases and location criteria.

Where to Buy Drugs: It helps users locate drug stores that carry specific medications within their desired region.

Latest Medical Information: Users can access up-to-date medical information on various topics, with content summaries generated through AI, along with proper citations for further reading.

The project utilizes Gradio for the user-friendly interface, making it a valuable tool for accessing critical healthcare information efficiently.
